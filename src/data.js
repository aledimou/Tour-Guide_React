      "The Gravensteen,The Castle of the Counts, is a medieval castle at Ghent, East Flanders in Belgium. The current castle dates from 1180 and was the residence of the Counts of Flanders until 1353. It was subsequently re-purposed as a court, prison, mint, and even as a cotton factory. It was restored over 1893–1903 and is now a museum and a major landmark in the city"

      "This castle was built by Philip of Alsace, Count of Flanders, in 1180. It was fully restored in the early 20C. Its architecture drew inspiration from Crusader forts in Syria. Inside the curtain wall, visitors can see the Romanesque gallery and fine rooms of the Count's House. One chamber contains a collection of instruments of torture, recalling that the castle served as a prison for many years. Note the fine view of Ghent and its surroundings from the top of the keep."

      "Mont-Saint-Michel was used in the sixth and seventh centuries as an Armorican stronghold of Gallo-Roman culture and power until it was ransacked by the Franks, thus ending the trans-channel culture that had stood since the departure of the Romans in 460. From roughly the fifth to the eighth century, Mont Saint-Michel belonged to the territory of Neustria and, in the early ninth century, was an important place in the marches of Neustria."
